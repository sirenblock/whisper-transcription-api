# 🎯 Claude Multi-Agent Orchestration System

**One command. Any project. Fully automated.**

---

## 🚀 What Is This?

A revolutionary system that uses **Claude AI to break down any project** into parallel tasks and **executes them simultaneously** across multiple Claude instances.

### Before (Manual):
```
Write code for Task 1 → 20 min
Write code for Task 2 → 20 min
Write code for Task 3 → 20 min
...
Total: 240 minutes (4 hours) for 12 tasks
```

### After (Orchestrator):
```
All 12 tasks running in parallel → 20 minutes
Total: 20 minutes for entire project ⚡
```

**12x faster. Zero manual work.**

## ⚡ Quick Start (Universal)

### For ANY New Project:

```bash
# 1. Go to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# 2. Copy the orchestrator
cp /path/to/claude-orchestrator.sh .

# 3. Create PROJECT.md
cat > PROJECT.md <<'EOF'
# Project: Your Project Name

## Description
What you want to build...

## Requirements
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Tech Stack
- Technology 1
- Technology 2
EOF

# 4. Run!
./claude-orchestrator.sh

# 5. Start keep-alive (optional but recommended)
./keep-alive-auto.sh
```

**Done!** Your project is being built in parallel.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (This Specific Project)

### For the Whisper API 12-Task Project:

```bash
# Just run this one command
./launch-all-12-ultimate.sh

# Then start keep-alive
./keep-alive-auto.sh
```

All 12 tasks launch automatically with pre-written prompts!

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Phase 1: AI Planning
```
PROJECT.md → Claude analyzes → Breaks into N tasks → Generates prompts
```

Claude intelligently:
- Analyzes your project requirements
- Determines optimal number of tasks (4-12)
- Creates independent, parallelizable work units
- Generates complete prompts for each task

### Phase 2: Orchestration
```
N tasks → Launch N terminals → Arrange in grid → Start processing
```

The orchestrator:
- Launches exactly N Claude instances
- Handles all trust prompts automatically
- Submits task-specific prompts
- Arranges windows visually
- Tracks all window IDs

### Phase 3: Execution
```
All tasks process in parallel → 15-20 minutes → Complete project
```

Watch all terminals work simultaneously in a grid layout!

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Grid Layout

Edit `calc_grid_dimensions()` in `claude-orchestrator.sh`:

```bash
calc_grid_dimensions() {
    local count=$1
    local cols=4  # 4 columns instead of 3
    local rows=3  # 3 rows instead of 4
    echo "$cols $rows"
}
```

### Adjust Keep-Alive Frequency

Edit generated `keep-alive-auto.sh`:

```bash
sleep 3  # Change to 5 for less frequent
```

### Use Different Claude Model

Modify launch command in orchestrator:

```bash
set newWindow to do script "claude --model opus"
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Write Better PROJECT.md
- Be specific and detailed
- List all requirements clearly
- Mention tech stack preferences
- Include constraints or special needs

### 2. Monitor Progress
- Keep all terminal windows visible
- Check for stuck processes
- Watch for permission prompts

### 3. Use Keep-Alive
Always run `./keep-alive-auto.sh` after orchestration to handle:
- Permission prompts
- Stuck inputs
- Session timeouts

### 4. Review Generated Code
After completion:
- Check each terminal for generated code
- Review for consistency across tasks
- Test thoroughly before deployment

### 5. Iterate If Needed
- Refine PROJECT.md based on results
- Re-run orchestrator with updated requirements
- Tasks can be re-executed independently

---

## 🎯 Best Use Cases

### ✅ Perfect For:
- **Full-stack apps**: Frontend, backend, database, deployment
- **Microservices**: Each service as separate task
- **API development**: Routes, auth, integrations, docs
- **Data pipelines**: Ingestion, processing, storage, viz
- **Multi-component systems**: Break by component
- **Large refactors**: Split by module or feature

### ⚠️ Not Ideal For:
- Single, non-divisible tasks
- Highly sequential work
- Tasks requiring constant iteration
- Projects < 3 independent components

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No PROJECT.md found"
Create one with your project description first.

### "Failed to break down project"
- Add more detail to PROJECT.md
- Check `.claude-orchestrator/breakdown.json`
- Ensure requirements are clear

### Windows not processing
- Run `./keep-alive-auto.sh`
- Manually press Enter in stuck windows
- Check for permission prompts

### Wrong number of tasks
- Claude optimizes for 4-12 tasks automatically
- Add/remove detail in PROJECT.md to influence count

### Grid layout issues
- Modify `calc_grid_dimensions()` function
- Manually resize if needed
